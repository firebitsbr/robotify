# robotify

A browser extension that places a small robot icon in the toolbar that &mdash; when clicked &mdash; will extract the fully-qualified host name from the current tab and open up the `robots.txt` file for that site (if there is one) in a new tab.

## Using robotify

Download the [signed extension](dist/robotify-0.1.0-an+fx.xpi) in `dist` (`robotify-0.1.0-an+fx.xpi`) and install it manually or clone the repo and load it as a temporary addon via `about:debugging`.
